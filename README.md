# InjuryCounter

The software for an injury counter.

Uses the following items:
Arduino UNO
Seven Segment Displays
4511 Decoder ICs
470 Ohm Resistors
Tactile Switches

When a button is pressed, the count returns to zero.

Provides functionality for using either direct connection or a 4511 Decoder to a seven segment module to display the counter.

Scability has been integrated so that any number of seven segment displays can be connected, limited physically by the interface pins on the Arduino.
